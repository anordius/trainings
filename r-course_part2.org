This was the contents of second part in our weekly R-Course series, Saturday 17, May 2025, Sokoine University of Agriculture, College of Forestry, Wildlife and Tourism (Postgraduates). There were some additions to meet the need of trainees, but merely the contents remained the same, no ommision was made.

This contents is available at this github repository [[https://github.com/anordius/trainings/blob/main/trainings.org][Github repository]].

                /Happy Coding!/

1. Tidy data
   What is tidy data and why tidy data

2. Importing Datasets

3. Reshaping data
   1) Basics
      - Wide data format
      - Long data format

   2) ~tidyr~ package and related functions
      - =pivot_wider()=
      - =pivot_longer()=
4. Data Wrangling
   1) ~dplyr~ package and related functions (The main package for data wrangling in tidyverse ecosystem)
      1. =%>%= - pipe operator for chaining a sequence of operations
      2. =glimpse()= - get an overview of what's included in dataset
      3. =filter()= - filter rows
      4. =select()= - select, rename, and reorder columns
      5. =rename()= - rename columns
      6. =arrange()= - reorder rows
      7. =mutate()= - create a new column
      8. =group_by()= - group variables
      9. =summarize()= - summarize information within a dataset
      10. =left_join()= - combine data across data frame
      11. =tally()= - get overall sum of values of specified column(s) or the number of rows of tibble
      12. =count()= - get counts of unique values of specified column(s) (shortcut of =group_by()= and =tally()=)
      13. =add_count()= -  add values of =count()= as a new column
      14. =add_tally()= - add value(s) of =tally()= as a new column
   2) =tidyr= package other functions
   3) =skimr= for quick summary
   4) =janitor= for cleaning data
      - =clean_names()= - clean column names
      - =tabyl()= - create a frequency table
      - =adorn_totals()= - add total row/column to a table
      - =adorn_percentages()= - add percentage to a table
      - =adorn_title()= - add title to a table
5. Basics of Regression Modelling in R (Cross-sectional data)
